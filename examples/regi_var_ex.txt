Parameters
pipe_name : str
    The name of the pipeline. regi (registration) or proc_3d (3d process).
dat_list : list  
    The list of input file paths (default is ''). User can input multiple
    files by saparating comma. By doing this way, we can do registration 
    with multiple source and target files.
output : str
    The path for storing output file. If user doesn't specify the path,
    It saves the output in the DataLab_test/output/ path.
verbose : bool
    Boolean statement to control the print (default is False).
use_dat_ex : bool
    Boolean statement for using example ICP dataset (default is False).
    If use_dat_ex is True, the dat_src and dat_tar will be overwritten by
    ICP dataset.
use_debug : bool
    By changing its to True, use can check and svae the all middle step
    of the calculation. It is useful for the debugging (default is False).
src_idx : int        
    The index of the source pcd file from the list. It will select the 
    file from the list based on the index.
tar_idx : int
    The index of the target pcd file from the list. It will select the
    file from the list based on the index.
trans_init : np.ndarray
    The initial transformation guess (The default is the nan array).
voxel_size : float
    The input voxel size by the user (The default is nan). 
num_bins : float
    The number of bins that user want to divide the bounding box. It will
    be only used if user didn't set the voxel size.
rad_down : float
    The radius limitation for the KDTree function in the down sampling
    function (The default is nan).
rad_fpfh : float
    The radius limitation for the KDTree function in the fpfh feature
    function (The default is nan).
rad_down_fac : flaot
    The radius factor for the down sampling. If user didn't specify the
    radius for the down sampling, It will be calculated by product of
    the radius factor and voxel size (The default is 2).
rad_fpfh_fac : float
    The radius factor for the fpfh feature. If user didn't specify the 
    radius for fpfh feature, It will be calculated by product of the
    radius factor and voxel size (The default is 5).
max_nn_down : int
    The neighboring bin limitation for the KDTree function in the down
    sampling function (The default is 30).
max_nn_fpfh : int
    The neighboring bin limitation for the KDTree function in the fpfh
    feature function (The default is 100).
src_idx_ran : int
    The index of the source pcd file from the list. It will select the
    file from the list based on the index. It is for RANSAC registration.
tar_idx_ran : int
    The index of the target pcd file from the list. It will select the
    file from the list based on the index. It is for RANSAC registration.
dis_thres : float
    The distance threshold for the CorrespondenceCheckerBasedOnDistance()
    class (Default is np.nan). 
dis_thres_fac : flaot
    The distance threshold factor for the pruning step. If user didn't 
    specify it, It will be calculated by product of the factor and 
    averaged voxel size from the preprocessing (Default is 1.5).
ang_thres : float
    The angle threshold for the normal related pruning step. It is
    currently disabled (Default is 2 * np.pi).
mutual_filt : bool
    Enables mutual filter such that the correspondence of the source 
    pointâ€™s correspondence is itself(Default is True). 
ratio : float 
    The ratio threshold for the edge length related pruning step 
    (Default is 0.9).
max_iter : int
    The hyperparameter for the minimization. It is the maximum limitation
    of the number of iterations (Default is 100000). 
confi : float
    The hyperparameter for the minimization. It is the limitation for
    confidence probability of the fitness(Default is 0.999).
scaling : bool
    The scaling threshold for the point to point estimation (Default is False).
src_idx_icp : int   
    The index of the source pcd file from the list. It will select the
    file from the list based on the index. It is for the ICP registration.
tar_idx_icp : int
    The index of the target pcd file from the list. It will select the
    file from the list based on the index. It is for the ICP registration.       
dis_thres_icp : float
    The distance threshold for the maximum correspondence between data
    (Default is np.nan). It is for the ICP registration. 
dis_thres_fac_icp : flaot
    The distance threshold factor. If user didn't specify it, It will be
    calculated by product of the factor and averaged voxel size from the
    preprocessing (Default is 0.4). It is for the ICP registration.
max_iter_icp : int
    The hyperparameter for the minimization. It is the maximum limitation
    of the number of iterations (Default is 2000). 
    It is for the ICP registration.
trans_init_icp : np.ndarray
    The initial transformation guess from RANSAC (The default is the nan array).
    It is for the ICP registration.
use_p2p : bool
    The boolean statement for controlling which estimation method user
    will be used (Default is False).
